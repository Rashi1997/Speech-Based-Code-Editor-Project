## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo onto your computer using git.
```
git clone https://github.com/somahota/Speech-Based-Code-Editor-Project.git
```
2. Launch Eclipse and go to `File` -> `Open Projects from File` to browse and load the `Voice2Code` folder from the repository you just cloned.
3. Now that the `Voice2Code` folder is in the eclipse-workspace make sure you have `Eclipse Plugin Development Tools` installed by following the steps below.
    1. Go to `Help` -> `Install New Software`.
    2. Select `The Eclipse Project Updates - http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.17` from the `Work with` dropdown.
    3. Select `Eclipse Plugin Development Tools` from under `Name`.
    4. Click Next. Once the installation is done, Eclipse will ask to restart, please do so.
4. Make sure you have `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable set up in the `Run Configurations` under Run in Eclipse. (follow [this](#setting-up-gcloud-key) guide to get GCloud key setup)
5. To run the plugin, right-click the project (make sure that is `Voice2Code`) and click `Run As` -> `Eclipse Application`.
4. To view the plugin go to `Window`->`Show View`->`Other`->`Voice 2 Code`-> `Voice 2 Code`.
6. This will open up a new Eclipse window with the GUI with Press to Speak.

## Setting up GCloud Key

1. Sign in on the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) with your Google account. 
2. Follow [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart-gcloud#before_you_begin) to set up a new project with Speech-to-Text API.
3. Lastly, follow [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#setting_up_authentication) to create and download the Service Account key. 
4. This key is downloaded as a JSON file. Please make sure Eclipse has an environment variable set up like below. (Note: `my-key` is a placeholder)
```
variable: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
value: /home/user/Downloads/<my-key>.json
```

## Troubleshooting

May things can go wrong with Eclipse.

1. If you don't see `Voice 2 Code` in the View menu, make sure you have `.project` file inside Eclipse workspace.
2. If the microphone does not work, due to getting shared with other applications, launch Eclipse from the terminal using this command on MAC OS.
```
/Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse &!
```
